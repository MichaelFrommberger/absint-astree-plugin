   When this option is activated, the analysis is not stored on the Astrée server, instead it is automatically deleted after the analysis run of the build step.
   <br>
   This option is very helpful if the analysis run is only specified by a DAX file and it is not intended to archive each analysis run on the server.
   <br>
   Please be aware that using this option in an analysis run only specified by an analysis ID will result in deleting the analysis with that ID on the Astrée server.
   <br>
   This option corresponds to adding a <i>--drop</i> to a command line call to Astrée.
